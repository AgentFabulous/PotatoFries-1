/// PageLayout
///
/// This file contains the definition of the PageLayout class and all the methods.
/// This class is abstract and needs to be extended before being used anywhere.
///
///
/// What makes a PageLayout?
///
/// A PageLayout is made of simply one thing: a body. This body isn't defined by default (it's abstract)
/// and it has to be defined when extending the class.
/// Basically a body tells what's inside a PageLayout, so all the widgets that compose a page must go in there.
/// A body MUST have Sections as its only root children, anything else is prohibited.
/// A body, when compiled, gets passed a required context and an optional provider, those get used by the
/// widgets inside the function body.
/// The body gets compiled on [PageLayout.build].
///
///
/// More info about [PageLayout.build]
///
/// This is a method that should usually not be overridden, but if you really have to override it, be sure
/// to call the super method.
/// This method basically compiles body, cycles through its children and, by creating a new list, assign to
/// each of them a key, used on ListViews to scroll. When it finishes cycling, it returns a Map, that passes
/// two params: keys body.
/// Keys contains a list of GlobalKeys that were assigned on compilation, its used to the page manager for
/// scrolling to the item when clicked on the search route;
/// Body, as the name suggests, passes the widget to actually build.
///
/// This method gets passed three arguments: context, a selectedIndex and an optional provider.
/// Context and provider get used to call body and to get the contents, while selectedIndex gets used for
/// highlighting the current selected item.
///
///
/// Let's talk about [PageLayout.compileProviders]
///
/// This is a method that should be called only once, at app startup basically. We don't need to compile
/// searchProviders anytime after anyways so it's fine.
/// It basically cycles through the body (and their children ofc) to add every single supported item
/// into the SearchProviders list that gets used to index search items.
/// It uses lots of magic and you don't really need to know how it works, it just worksâ„¢
///
///
/// Last but not least, [PageLayout.categoryIndex]
///
/// This is really just a little int value that stores the page category index data used for SearchProviders,
/// that's all lol
///
